# Changelog

Major changes and improvements in each release of cinq, newest first.

## Unreleased

## v0.1.2

- On Windows, a terminal that starts cinq shows what cinq prints, such as
  the problems of `config.toml` and the output of `--help`, and waits until
  cinq closes.  Explorer still starts cinq without a console window.
- Video cues decode with rust_h264, a decoder written in Rust, in place of
  Cisco's openh264, so that building cinq compiles no C++, its program no
  longer needs the C++ library, and it builds on riscv64.  A sample that
  fails to decode now costs no picture but its own.
- On a terminal, the problems of `config.toml` take a screen of their own
  while any are left, as a pager's text does, so that fixing the file brings
  back the prompt and what came before it instead of a cleared screen.
  Problems still left when cinq ends stay on the terminal.
- The Nix packages for other systems go by the systems that they run on, as
  `.#aarch64-darwin`, `.#x86_64-windows`, and `.#aarch64-windows`, in place of
  `.#aarch64-darwin-cross`, `.#x86_64-windows-cross`, and
  `.#aarch64-windows-cross`.
- A picture fading out no longer jumps back to whole when a panic, or
  another fade that stops its cue, takes over; it fades on from where it
  was.
- Video 1280 pixels wide that is cropped below 720 lines, such as
  letterboxed high definition, shows in the colors of high definition.
- On Darwin, cinq follows the changes to `config.toml` in a directory
  reached through a symbolic link, such as one under `/tmp`.
- On FreeBSD and the other BSDs, cinq follows the changes that an editor
  writes into `config.toml` in place, and not only those that rename another
  file over it.
- A cue that GO fires right after a sound or video that could not play
  ended the last running cue no longer starts ahead by the time spent idle.
- Choosing again the file that a running audio or video cue plays, or
  typing its name with a space around it, leaves the cue playing.
- cinq formats `config.toml` each time it is saved, as taplo formats TOML by
  default, but never reorders keys or the items of arrays and inline tables.
  A file that is not TOML stays as it is.
- On GNU/Linux, Nix cross-builds cinq for FreeBSD, as `.#x86_64-freebsd` and
  `.#aarch64-freebsd`, and for GNU/Linux on riscv64, as `.#riscv64-linux`.

## v0.1.1

- Picture cues show a PNG or JPEG on the stage window until a fade, a stop
  cue, or Panic ends them.
- The stage window opens as a window, which the operator can move to the
  display of the audience, and each GO that fires a picture or video cue
  makes it fullscreen on that display.  The fullscreen key turns it back
  into a window until the next such GO.
- Problems in `config.toml` show on standard error each time that cinq
  reads the file, at startup and on each change, with the lines around each
  problem and its place marked, and the sidebar gives the line of each.  On
  a terminal, only the problems of the latest reading stay on screen, so
  that fixing the file clears it, and a file without problems prints
  nothing.
