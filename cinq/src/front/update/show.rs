//! Shows that the operator opens and saves, and the unsaved changes that
//! cinq keeps for them
//!
//! A show lives in a file of its own, which the operator names on the
//! command line or picks in the desktop's file chooser.  Opening reads the
//! file and saving writes it, both on a thread of their own, as any reading
//! of files is.  Changes that are not saved never go away unasked: as they
//! happen, the [`Keeper`] keeps them in a file in the state directory of
//! cinq, which the next opening of the show reads, so that neither closing
//! the window, nor opening another show, nor a crash loses them.  The kept
//! changes come back as one change, which undo takes back to the show as
//! saved, so that nothing has to ask first.
