//! Keys and the keyboard focus
//!
//! Keys typed outside any text field go to the key bindings in
//! [`crate::front::keymap`], and the keys of a command typed halfway wait
//! in the interface state until the command is complete.  The inspector and
//! the toolbar keep the keys typed into their fields, apart from the keys
//! that act in fields: those of GO and Panic, of the moves between fields,
//! and of opening and saving shows.  iced moves the keyboard focus only on
//! clicks, so the keys that edit fields move it themselves.
