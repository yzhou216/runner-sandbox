//! Watching the configuration file, so that the keys follow it while the
//! program runs
//!
//! Editors often save a file by writing another and renaming it over the
//! first, which ends any watch on the file itself, so the watcher watches
//! the directory that holds the file instead.  While that directory is
//! missing, it watches the nearest one above that exists, so that making
//! the directories and then the file comes through as well.  Each burst of
//! changes reads the file once, after it settles, and each reading writes
//! out the problems with the file, which go to standard error in the
//! program, as [`errors`] tells.
//!
//! The watch waits for changes on iced's executor, whose workers keep the
//! clock ticking, and leaves reading and writing to threads: each reading
//! of the file runs on a thread of its own, and a thread of the watch's own
//! writes out the problems, since a write to standard error can wait
//! without end, as it does while a terminal is paused with Control+s.
