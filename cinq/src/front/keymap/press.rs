//! Key presses, named as the W3C UI Events specification names keys
//!
//! A key is written as its value in the specification's list of key values,
//! <https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-key/>: a key that types a character as
//! that character, as in `j`, `G`, or `?`, and any other key by name, as in
//! `Enter`, `Escape`, or `ArrowDown`.  The space bar, whose key value is the
//! space it types, is written `Space`, as the specification's code values
//! name it.  Control, Alt, and Shift go before a key, joined to it by `+`,
//! as in `Control+d` or `Shift+Tab`, and Shift on a letter makes the
//! capital that it types.
