//! Menu of a drop-down list, which opens below the list or above it,
//! wherever there is more room, and scrolls when the options do not fit
//!
//! The options sit in iced's scrollable, so the menu scrolls and shows its
//! scroll bar as iced's own menu does.  The mouse highlights the option
//! under it and picks the option it presses, and the keys move the
//! highlight, which the menu scrolls into view.  A click beside the menu
//! closes it and acts as it would with the menu closed, apart from a click
//! on the list, which only closes the menu.
//!
//! iced hands each batch of events first to the menu that is open when the
//! batch begins, then to the widgets under it, so a menu that closes
//! partway through a batch leaves the rest of the batch to them.
