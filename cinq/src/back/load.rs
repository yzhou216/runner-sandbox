//! Loading the files that audio, video, and picture cues name, which reads
//! them
//!
//! [`load_files`] finds how long each file plays, or why it cannot be
//! played, without decoding it: the sound output reads sound files, and the
//! video output reads video files, along with their sound tracks, which the
//! sound output then reads in turn, and picture files, of which it reads
//! the header alone.  Reading can block on a slow drive, so the interface
//! runs it off its own thread.
