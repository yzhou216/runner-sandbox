//! Sound output, where the back end has side effects
//!
//! [`Audio::sync`] runs after every change to the workspace and makes the
//! sound match it: it starts the audio and video cues that the workspace
//! has sounding, follows their level and pause state, and stops the sounds
//! whose cue has stopped.  The workspace stays the only record of what
//! should be heard, so a sound that cannot start goes back to it as a file
//! that cannot be played.  Ahead of that, a thread of its own makes ready
//! the sounds that runs may start next, so that GO waits on no file.  The
//! sound of a video file plays as that of a sound file does, from the
//! file's sound track, along with the silence that AAC encoders put around
//! the sound, since the decoder reads no edit list, which marks that
//! silence for players to skip.
